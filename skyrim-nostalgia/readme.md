Skyrim Nostalgia

It is a fan based website to a game called "Skyrim". It is a part of the Elder Scrolls Game Franchise where in Skyrim is the 5th entry and was released on November 11, 2011 (11/11/11). This game was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and is published by Bethesda Softworks.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open-world action RPG game which is a free-exploration fantasy world that includes dragons! 

Up until now, there are still gamers who play this game even though it has been 14 years since its release. So I made this website dedicated to my fellow Skyrim fans that placed countless hours of gameplay filled with adventure, curiosity, challenge and enjoyment.
