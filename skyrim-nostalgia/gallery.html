      <em>Dawnguard</em> introduces a dark conflict between the ancient order of vampire hunters and the

      beloved addition to the game.

         SKYRIM EDITIONS SECTION
    ============================ -->
    <h2>Skyrim Editions</h2>

    <h3>Original Edition (2011)</h3>
    <p>
      The original release of <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> launched in 2011 and became an instant
      classic. It introduced the vast open world of Skyrim, the Dragonborn storyline, and countless quests,
      dungeons, and characters that defined a generation of RPGs.
    </p>

    <h3>Legendary Edition (2013)</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Legendary Edition</strong> bundled the base game with all three DLCs — Dawnguard,
      Hearthfire, and Dragonborn — along with all gameplay updates. It became the definitive version for
      last‑gen consoles.
    </p>

    <h3>Special Edition (2016)</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Special Edition</strong> brought Skyrim to modern hardware with enhanced graphics,
      improved lighting, volumetric god rays, and upgraded performance. It also introduced mod support on
      consoles for the first time.
    </p>

    <h3>VR Edition (2017)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Skyrim VR</strong> offered a fully immersive version of the game, allowing players to explore
      Tamriel in virtual reality. It included the base game and all DLCs, redesigned for VR controls and
      movement.
    </p>

    <h3>Nintendo Switch Edition (2017)</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Switch Edition</strong> brought Skyrim to a portable console for the first time. It
      included motion controls, Amiibo support, and exclusive items inspired by <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Anniversary Edition (2021)</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Anniversary Edition</strong> celebrated Skyrim’s 10th anniversary. It included the Special
      Edition plus over 500 pieces of Creation Club content — new quests, weapons, armor, spells, fishing,
      survival mode, and more.
    </p>

    <h3>Ultimate Modded Experience (Community)</h3>
    <p>
      While not an official edition, the modding community has created massive overhauls like
      <strong>Skyrim Together Reborn</strong>, <strong>Requiem</strong>, <strong>Skyblivion</strong>, and
      <strong>Skywind</strong>, keeping the game alive and evolving more than a decade later.
